It looks like the iframe's size and position are set specifically for larger screens, which may not scale well on smaller screens like phones. Here are a few adjustments you can try:

Add a Media Query in CSS: Use media queries to adjust the iframe size specifically for smaller screens.

css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    .laptop iframe {
        width: 300px;
        height: 200px;
    }
}
Dynamic distanceFactor in <Html>: Adjust distanceFactor in the <Html> component to make the iframe scale based on the deviceâ€™s viewport. You could make this dynamic by detecting the device type or screen size:

jsx
Copy code
<Html
    wrapperClass="laptop"
    position={[.03, 1.15, -1.54]}
    transform
    distanceFactor={window.innerWidth < 600 ? 0.8 : 1.16} // Smaller on phones
    rotation-x={-1.6}
    rotation-y={-.01}
    rotation-z={-.001}
>
    <iframe src="https://2-d-for-portfolio.vercel.app/" />
</Html>
Set the <iframe> to Scale Responsively: Within the CSS for the iframe itself, add styles to let it scale responsively:

css
Copy code
.laptop iframe {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 500px;
    height: auto;
    aspect-ratio: 500 / 310;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 15px;
}
